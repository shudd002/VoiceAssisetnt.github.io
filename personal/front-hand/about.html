<h1>About Me <span>ðŸ’ª</span></h1>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Shubham.</p>
<p>
  I was born and raised in India. I am a MERN Stack Developer with a strong passion for
  building robust and scalable applications. Over the past few years, I've contributed to
  several full-stack projects that delivered real-world value.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy solving real-world problems using technology. I create modern web experiences with
  clean UI/UX, RESTful APIs, and scalable backend logic.
</p>
<p>
  My tech stack includes MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and Git. Iâ€™m always eager to learn
  new things, collaborate with teams, and continuously improve.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of coding, I love reading tech blogs, helping the developer community, and working
  on open-source side projects.
